# Toby Magick

## Installation
Installing the script should only need to happen once. Run the [Install.ps1](./Install.ps1) script to generate a shortcut to the TobyMagick.ps1 script that you can place anywhere to run the application.

### Current Tasks

- Fix clock to use class instances instead of global references
- Fix the output image from ImageMagick to not be so squished
